# 13Grid

A 13 column grid.

## WHY?

Because none of the current 12 column grids satisfies me. I have used Bootstrap, Foundation, Pure and Toast and none of them have really convinced me.

I’m not sure if this is the first open source 13 grid column, I started it at school without internet using Sketch and haven’t stopped since. I don’t want to Google if another one already exists.

### To-Do

- Docs for usage



## 13 columns

I haven’t really used the 1/12 unit ever, so, I am dropping it or at least, dropping the 1/13.

I love centered stuff and 12 column grids didn’t satisfied me. I sketched a 13 column one to use one as a center and put in a lot of whitespace.

We are talking about a 30px FIXED gutter.

The standard size for the whole grid is 960px.

## The containers

### The Unit

The unit is also the gutter. There are 13 units in 13Grid. Woah.

Default width @ 960px: 60px

Percentage width: 6.25%

### The One

Used for full content width, it’ll leave a unit of space at each side.

Default width @ 960px: 840px

Percentage width: 87.5%

### The Half

Kind of half the One.

Default width @ 960px: 390px

Percentage width: 40.625%

### The Third

Kind of a third of the One.

Default width @ 960px: 240px

Percentage width: 25%

### The Fourth

Kind of a fourth of the One.

Default width @ 960px: 165px

Percentage width: 17.1875%

### The Sixth

Kind of a sixth of the One.

Default width @ 960px: 90px

Percentage width: 9.375%

### The Two Thirds

Kind of 2 one thirds.

Default width @ 960px: 540px

Percentage width: 56.625% — Magic number may be?
