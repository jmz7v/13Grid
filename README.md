# 13Grid

A 13 column grid.

## WHY?

Because none of the current 12 column grids satisfies me. I have used Bootstrap, Foundation, Pure and Toast and none of them have really convinced me.

I’m not sure if this is the first open source 13 grid column, I started it at school without internet using Sketch and haven’t stopped since. I don’t want to Google if another one already exists.


## 13 columns

I haven’t really used the 1/12 unit ever, so, I am dropping it or at least, dropping the 1/13.

I love centered stuff and 12 column grids didn’t satisfied me. I sketched a 13 column one to use one as a center and put in a lot of whitespace.

We are talking about a 30px FIXED gutter.

The standard size for the whole grid is 960px.

## The containers

### The Unit

The unit is also the gutter. There are 13 units in 13Grid.

Woah.

Default width @ 960px: 60px;
Percentage width: 6.25%;
